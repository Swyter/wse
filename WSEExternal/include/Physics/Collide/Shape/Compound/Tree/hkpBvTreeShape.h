/// <b>What does the bounding volume tree do?</b><br>
///
/// A bounding volume tree is useful in situations where you need to check for collisions between a moving object
/// and a large static geometry, such as a landscape. <br> \n
/// The shapes that make up the landscape are hierarchically grouped in
/// a binary bounding volume tree.
/// At every node in the tree there exists a bounding polytope, which encapsulates all 
/// of its children. The top-level bounding volume contains the entire landscape, while
/// the nodes on the leaf levels encapsulate one geometric primitive, normally a
/// triangle. The fit of this bounding volume can be perfect (as in some AABB trees), or can 
/// have an extra margin/tolerance built in (e.g. MOPP):\n\n\n
/// <center><img src="pix/twoTriangles.gif"></center>\n
///
/// Instead of checking whether the moving object is colliding with each of the triangles in the landscape in turn,
/// which would be extremely time-consuming, the bounding box of the moving object
/// is checked against the bounding volume tree - first, whether it is intersecting with the top-level bounding volume, then with
/// any of its child bounding volumes, and so on until the check reaches the leaf nodes. A list of any potentially colliding triangles
/// is then passed to the narrowphase collision detection. You can think of
/// the bounding volume tree as a filter to the narrowphase collision
/// detection system.<br>
