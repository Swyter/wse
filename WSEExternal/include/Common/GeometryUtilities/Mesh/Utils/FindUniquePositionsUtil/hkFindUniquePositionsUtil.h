/// hkFindUniquePositionsUtil is a utility to find vectors which have exactly the same x,y and z member values
///
/// To use, an object of hkFindUniquePositionsUtil should be instantiated. hkVector4 positions can then be added. Using
/// the addPosition method the index of the position added will be returned. If the position has already been added the
/// previously found values index will be returned. To check rapidly if a position has already been added - the
/// findPosition method will return the index of the position if it has been been added, or -1 if not.
///
/// Note that the algorithm is effectively using the precise bit combinations of the x, y and z values to determine
/// equality - there is no threshold for equality for example.
///
/// To get the array of all of the unique positions that have been added the m_positions member variable holds this
/// and is publically accessible.
///
/// The utility works by converting the x,y and z values of a hkVector4 into a hash value, and then keeping all the
/// indices to the values with the same has in a singly linked list.
