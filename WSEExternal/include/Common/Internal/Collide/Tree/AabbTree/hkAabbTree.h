		/// This function is optimized for moving objects. It checks whether the \a aabb is
		/// still completely inside the leaf's aabb, and if not it updates the
		/// leaf's aabb with the expanded input \a aabb. It uses \a expansionDirection and the \a expansionMargin to do this expansion.
		/// The expansionDirection is good for linear moving objects, the expansionMargin helps with rotating or curving objects.

		/// 
		/// Details if you really want to push performance:
		/// This implementation is optimized for brute force speed and will not try to optimize
		/// the search in a way that it searches the tree closer to the ray start first.
		/// To get the optimal performance, you should remember the hitRatio for each ray you fire
		/// and in the next frame initialize \a initialEarlyOutFraction with the slightly increased value from the previous frame.
		/// Only if you do not get a hit, recast the ray with \a initialEarlyOutFraction set to 1.0f.
		/// 
		///	Example: You are standing in front of a wall and want to check whether you can see anything behind it.
		/// This function can now potentially start checking against lots of object behind the wall first.
		/// To avoid this in subsequent frames you simple cast a short ray from your eye's position to the last
		/// hitpoint on the wall, plus 1 meter. Only if this shortened ray does not hit, you will have to recast
		/// using the full ray length.
