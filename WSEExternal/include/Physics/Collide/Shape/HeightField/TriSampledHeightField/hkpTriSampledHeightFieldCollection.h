/// where a different collision algorithm is used, while maintaining the memory usage of the heightfield.
/// Instead of the approximate collision detection algorithm used by the heightfield shape (where colliding objects
/// are represented by sets of spheres), this shape converts the heightfield into triangles on the fly.
/// Collision detection may be slower, but will be fully exact.
/// Because the shapes pulled out during collision detection are actual hkTriangleShapes, they may need a radius
/// (which would not be necessary if using the approximate collision detection algorithm).
/// Ray casting is performed using the standard heightfield raycast implementation.
/// N.B. Per-triangle filtering can be done by inheriting and implementing the method hkpShapeCollection::getCollisionFilterInfo( hkpShapeKey key )
/// as required. The current implementation does not implement this method because the user can best decide where to store the filter info.
/// NOTE: Linear casting is performed using a simple implementation where the aabb of the linear cast is queried against
/// the heightfield, and all overlapping triangles are checked with a linear cast. WARNING: for long linear casts,
/// (particularly those parallel to the heightfield surface) this can be very slow.
