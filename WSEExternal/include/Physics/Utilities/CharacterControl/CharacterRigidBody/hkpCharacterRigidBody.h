/// The character rigid body class is used to represent a rigid body that can move dynamically around 
/// the scene. It is called character rigid body because it is usually used to represent game characters. 
/// It is a rigid body analogy to hkpCharacterProxy controller. But opposite to hkpCharacterProxy, which 
/// is represented by virtual phantom shape, hkpCharacterRigidBody controller is physically presented in the dynamic scene. 
/// Its movement is controlled by direct setting its linear and angular velocities.
///
/// If a characterRigidBodyListener has been added, then the character rigid body issues a callback to it every
/// simulation step. The default behavior of the characterRigidBodyListener has two main purposes.
///
/// The first usage is the modification of a mass of rigid body character during collision with dynamic objects in the scene.
/// This approach allows continuous regulation of "maximal force (power)" of character during interaction with other dynamics objects.
/// (Modification factor decreases the mass of rigid body during response calculation)
/// Modification factor is calculated in every step in contactProcessCallback() using the following formulas:
///
///  - Calculate angle alpha between contact normal and current acceleration
///  - Calculate current force applied to interaction object as F = mass*acceleration*cos(alpha)
///  - If (F > Fmax) calculate mass modification factor
///  - Apply mass modification factor to impulse calculation using hkpResponseModifier::setInvMassScalingForContact()
///
/// The acceleration is calculated as difference between the required output velocity from state machine and current
/// velocity of rigid body divided by timestep.
///
/// The second usage is the addition of extra contact points to avoid movement of character on "steep" plane. "Steep" plane is defined
/// by m_maxSlope parameter. It's a angle between UP direction and normal of the plane. So vertical plane has PI/2 (90 Deg) and horizontal plane 0.
/// Default value is PI/3 (60 Deg).
///
/// Implementation detail:
/// In order to issue the calls to the listener's callback, the character rigid body is a hkpWorldPostSimulationListener.
/// It is automatically added as a listener to the world when its rigid body is added as an entity. This is achieved
/// by being an hkpEntityListener to its rigid body. The user need not add or remove the character rigid body as an
/// hkpEntityListener or a hkpWorldPostSimulationListener. This is done automatically to preserve the following invariant:
///   ( object is a PostSimulationListener ) iff ( ( m_character added to world ) and ( m_listener non-null ) )
